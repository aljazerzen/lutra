Language changes:
- remove significant whitespace (make pipes explicit)
- remove params (replaced by functions)
- require parenthesis for the main pipeline
- change function call syntax:
  - require parenthesis,
  - function name outside of parenthesis,
  - commas inside
- change function def syntax:
  - require `func` keyword,
  - parenthesis around params,
  - type annotations via `:`,
  - return type after parenthesis,
- remove implicit closures
- remove tuple coercion
- remove named function params (might re-add later)
- make functions calls non-pure (functions without arguments)
- recursive functions (or cycles of recursive functions) must have type annotations for parameters and body,
- remove table and column inference. Working without knowledge of the types is hard and cannot be fully relied upon.
- tables are functions that return the relations,
- variable declarations must be pure. Maybe we can achieve that with requiring them to be static/const?
