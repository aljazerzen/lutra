Lutra is:

- a data serialization framework.

  It defines a minimal algebraic type system and provides code generation tools for
  creating bindings in your language of choice.

- a RPC / API framework.

  The Lutra language can be used to specify an API in term of function declarations, which
  can be implemented in your language of choice. These functions can then be invoked via
  Lutra *programs*.

- a query language.

  Lutra programs are a high-level, statically typed turing-complete language, which be consumed
  and executed by the Lutra Runtime Engine or by specialized execution engines, such as relational
  SQL databases.
